        <h2>Sophomore Year</h2>
        <p>Sophomore year, over the course of both semesters I took Electricity and Magnetism for Physics, Introduction to Computer Science, Data Structures and Algorithms, Environmental Geochemistry, Numerical methods and Statistics, Reporting and Writing the News, Introduction to Linguistics, and Fluid Dynamics. Overall, the course I enjoyed the most was probably Linguistics because it was a completely new area of education in which I had not even touched and it was very positive towards learning from real life examples. The course I disliked the most was Environmental Geochemistry because the focus of the class felt all over the place and the content was presented in a way that made me more disinterested in the subject than I was before. This was the year I got into computer science and decided to Minor in it. I leaned Java and Python and realized that I liked the way it all logically fit together. This year also was my most difficult emotionally as I overloaded myself with other things like voice lessons at Eastman and being a Teaching Assistant. My inexperience with efficient time management, coupled with the sharp difficulty curve that classes like Fluid Dynamics and Numerical Methods really made it rough. The important part is I made it through.
